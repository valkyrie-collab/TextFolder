Q. What is Defination of a Problem.
Ans. In AI and computer science a problem is fully specified by its states, 
     actions, constraints and goal so that a algorithm can search for a solution.

Q. What is Characteristic of problem?
Ans. Decomposablity: Wheather it can be broken into smaller subproblem that are 
		     solved independently and combined.
     
     Deterministic vs uncertain: where next states outcome are predictable or 
				 involve uncetainity and incomplete information.

     Static vs dynamic: Whether the environment stays the same while solving, 
			or changes over time and must be tracked.

     Fully vs Partially Observed: Whether all needed information is available, 
				  or some is hidden/nosiy and  must be inferred.

     Single Agent and Multi Agent: Whether only one decision maker acts or 
				   multiple agents also matters.

     State vs path solution: Wheather only the final goal matters or the exact 
			     sequence of steps also matters

     Optimal vs satisficing: Whether the best solution is required or any 
			     solution that meets constraints is acceptable.
     
      Knowledge requirement: How much domain knowledge or heuristics are needed 
			     to guide search or learning.

      Time and resource limits: Constraints on computation time memory data or 
				energy that shape feasible methods

      Data availablity and learnablity: Whether enough data exist to learn 
					models and how well the problem supports 
					generalization.

Q. State space search.
Ans. State space search is a way to solve problems by exploring possible 
     situations and moves until a goal is reached. State space representation is 
     how those states actions and costs are formally described so an alogorithm 
     can search them. Problem formulation is the step of defining initial state, 
     action, goal test and costs so the search can be run

  i. View the problem as a graph where nodes are states and edges are actions that 
     move from one state to another.

  ii. Common strategis include uninformed and informed search
 
  iii. A Solution is a sequence of actions that transforms the initial state 
       into a goal state often minimizing a path cost if optimality is required.

Q. State space representation
Ans. i. Define the set of states S, the action set A, an Action(s) function 
        giving legal actions in s, a Result(s, a) function for the next state, 
        and a Cost(s, a) function for step cost.
     
     ii. Include the initial state sO and GoalTest(s) that returns true for 
         goal states; this makes the problem precise and machine-searchable. 
     
     iii. Good representations keep the branching factor and state size small to 
          make search efficient and avoid unnecessary duplicates.

Q. Problem Formulation
Ans. Initial State: the exact starting configuration.
     Actions/Operators: legal moves with precondition and effects.
     Transition model: how each action changes the state.
     Goal Test: a precise check for success.
     Path Cost/utility: what to optimize. 

Q. Intelligent Agent
Ans. An intelligent agent is a system that sence its environment decides what 
     to do and acts to achieve goals often improving performance over time. 
     It maps to actions to maximize a perfomance measure under given conditions.
 
Q. Type of Intelligent Agents
Ans. Simple reflex: Chooses actions using condition-action rules based only on 
		    the current percept no memory of the past.

     Model-based reflex: Keeps an internal state to track aspects of the world 
			 not directly obseved improving decisions.

     Goal-based: Uses goal to evaluate possible actions and select those that 
		 move it closer to goal states.

     Utility-based: Uses a utility function to trade off among goals and 
		    uncertainties selection actions with highest expected 
		    utility.

     Learning agent: Improves its performance from experience via learning 
		     components.

Q. Properties of intelligent agents
Ans. Autonomy: Operate without constant human guidance controlling their own 
	       actions

     Reactivity: Perceive changes and respond in a timely manner.

     Proactiveness: Take initiative to pursue goals agents via communication
		    protocols.

     Rationality: Select actions expected to maximize the performance measure 
		  given knowledge and resource.

     Adaptivity/Learing: Improve behavior over time from data and feedback.

     Robustness: Handle noise,uncertainty and partial observability.

     Efficiency: User time and memory effectively balance optimally with 
		 computational limits.

     Robustness:Handle noice uncertinity and partial observability

     Efficiency: Use time and memory effectively balance optimality with 
		 computational limits

     Safety and reliability: Avoid harmful actions and handle failures 
			     gracefully when operating in real settings

Q. Heuristic Search
Ans. Uses a heuristic function h(n) to rank or prioritize nodes that appear 
     closer to the goal Ex: Greedy Best-First and A*.

Q. Uninformed Search
Ans. Explores the state space using only the problem defination, with no 
     estimate of goal proximity example BFS, DFS, Uniform-Cost and Iterative 
     Deepening.

Q. BFS
Ans. Expands Nodes in increasing depth using FIFO queue. Time Complexity O(n^m)

Q. DFS
Ans. Expands the deepest unexpanded node first using a LIFO stack or recursion. 
     Time Complexity O(n * m)

Q. Application of AI. Real World application in various fields
Ans. Healthcare: Medical imaging and diagnosis assist doctors by spotting patterns 
		 in X-rays, MRI and CT scans for early diseases detection.
     
      Finance: Fraud detection flags unusual transaction in real time and reduces 
	      risk exposure.
	
      Retail and e-commerce: Recommendation engines personalize products and 
			     content increasing conversions.

      Manufacturing: Predictive maintainance prevents equipment failure by 
		     analyzing sensor data
      
      Security and safety: Anomaly detection monitors networks and cloud workloads 
			   for cyber threats

      Science and R&D: Materials and drug discovery models secreen candidates 
		       and predict properties
